This directory contains a formalization of the transaction flow
process of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain system.
 
It is for review of the article 
"Formalizing the Transaction Flow Process in Hyperledger Fabric" 
submitted to ICFEM 2020. 

The formalization is performed by 
Ximeng Li (lixm@cnu.edu.cn)
and 
Xiangyu Chen 

============================================================================

TO MACHINE-CHECK THE FORMALIZATION:

  System requirements: Coq 8.9.0
 
  Compilation: make all

TO STEP-THROUGH THE PROOF SCRIPTS: 

  Open a proof script file in Proof General and step through it

CONTENTS OF THE FILES:

LibTactics.v, SFLib.v:
The two files are imported or adapted from the content of the Software
Foundations library (https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/). They 
provide the infrastructure definitions, theorems, and tactics used in
this development.

MyUtils.v:
Utilities for the upate of functions and mappings

Entities.v:
Formalization of the entities involved in the transaction flow

TransFlow.v:
Formalization of Hyperledger Fabric transaction flow as a transition
system

Example.v:
Example transaction flow for duduction on the price of a car

Safety.v:
Mechanized proof of the preservation of consensus by the transaction
flow
